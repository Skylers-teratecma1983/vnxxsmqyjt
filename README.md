Just walked out. Lights were too bright. Or maybe it was the neon green of those creepers still burning my retinas. Was unreal. Anyway. The seats were comfy but my back feels like it’s been through a blender? Why’s popcorn always everywhere? Damn sticky floors.

Okay,  . Minecraft Movie, right? Was half expecting blocks to fall on my head. The theater was packed, some kid spilled his soda, like a mini oasis of syrup around my shoes. Oh, yeah, there’s that scene where Steve (wait, was that his name? I think so? the main blocky dude anyway) jumps. Literally jumps from a cliff swinging a pickaxe like he’s mining for diamonds or some lost hope. Made me think of when I tried bungee jumping once and screamed like...well, a dying goat I guess.

> The Enderman though?! Freaked me the hell out. I swear they stared right through the screen. Gave me shivers like when you get that weird feeling someone’s 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, you know? And the sound. Ugh, there’s this part where they mimic some of the game noises, but louder, more menacing...like a horde of angry cell phones buzzing in my brain. Remember to tell Tom about it. He wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , or was it just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦? Can’t remember.

They got the colors right. Vivid and blocky as in not-squarely, like, pixelated dreams or a parody of LEGO on acid. At some point, I swear an entire forest was on fire and I could feel the heat, or was it just too many bodies in the theater, the guy beside me breathing like Darth Vader… How do kids keep quiet during these things??

The plot? Ha, what plot. More a collection of “oh-look-a-sheep!” and random explosions. Was kinda like my thoughts on a Monday morning, when I’ve had too much coffee, sorta epically scattered. But at moments, God, some serene sense of nostalgia, like finding your old Game Boy at the bottom of a stressed-out drawer—unexpected and just straight-up smile-inducing.

Anyway, definitely something to see when you just want to shut off your brain. Catharsis in pixels. Was it art? Dunno, but neither is my cooking, and I still eat.

Not sure if that helped. U might wanna bring earplugs or extra patience or an umbrella? Don’t ask. Just don’t. The   was…Minecraft?

      print(Oh wow.)
  elif   == missed:
      print(Pixels much?)
  return setup
